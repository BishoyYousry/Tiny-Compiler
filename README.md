## **Description**
The “Tiny” compiler is written in C++ and using the Qt framework. The 
compiler takes a source code file as input and performs lexical analysis 
(scanning) and syntactic analysis (parsing) to generate a syntax tree. The 
syntax tree represents the structure and meaning of the source code. The 
compiler can detect the errors in scanning process.

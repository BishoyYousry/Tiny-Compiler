## **Description**
The “Tiny” compiler written in C++ and using Qt framework. The compiler 
can take (either a tiny source code written in *.tiny file or tiny tokens
written in *.token file). The input file is (either by opening an existing file 
or by creating a newer one). The compiler performs lexical analysis 
(scanning) and syntactic analysis (parsing) to generate a syntax tree. The 
syntax tree represents the structure and meaning of the source code. The 
syntax tree sets all statements inside rectangles, all expressions and the 
unexpected values inside ellipses. The compiler can detect the errors in 
scanning process. Also we can compiler more than one source code 
without closing and reopening the compiler.
